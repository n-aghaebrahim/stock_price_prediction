# Stock Price Prediction using Conv2D+LSTM

This repository contains code for predicting stock prices using a deep learning model with a combination of Conv2D and LSTM layers. The model processes historical stock price data along with technical indicators to make predictions for future stock prices. The entire workflow is organized into separate modules, each serving a specific purpose in the prediction process.

Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.7 or later
TensorFlow 2.0 or later
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
yfinance
Scikit-learn
## Modules Description

1. **`config_run.py`**: This module is responsible for configuring the entire prediction process. It allows you to select whether to train, predict, or update the model. You can also define the model's architecture, hyperparameters, and data selection preferences in this file.

2. **`data_gen.py`**: The data generation module is used to fetch historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance and prepare the data in the relevant shapes required for training and prediction.

3. **`decision.py`**: After making predictions, this module analyzes the predicted results and decides whether to buy or sell the stock based on predefined rules or criteria.

4. **`indicators.py`**: The indicators module applies various technical indicators to the stock price data, creating new data structures with additional features that can potentially enhance prediction accuracy.

5. **`model_design.py`**: This module defines the structure of the deep learning model. It leverages a hybrid architecture with Conv2D and LSTM layers to capture spatial and temporal patterns in the data.

6. **`plot.py`**: The plot module generates visualizations during the training process, such as lag and autocorrelation figures, helping to analyze the model's performance.

7. **`train_predict.py`**: This module contains the code for model training and predictions. It utilizes the data generated by `data_gen.py` and the model structure defined in `model_design.py` to train the model and make predictions.

8. **`run.py`**: After configuring the settings in `config_run.py`, this module is used to execute the entire prediction process. It serves as the entry point for training, prediction, and model updating.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies

2. Configure the prediction settings in `config_run.py` according to your requirements.

3. Run `run.py` to start the prediction process.

Data Collection

The model collects historical stock price data for a specific symbol from Yahoo Finance. You can modify the START_DATE_FOR_CAPTURING_DATA variable in the config_run.py file to specify the start date for data collection.

Model Architecture

The architecture of the model is based on a combination of Conv2D and LSTM layers. It leverages both spatial and temporal patterns to make accurate stock price predictions. The model configuration can be adjusted in the config_run.py file.

Training

To train the model, set the TRAIN_CONDITION variable to True in the config_run.py file. The model will be trained on historical data with various sequence lengths (N_STEPS) defined in the configuration.

Model Update

If you want to update the model with recent data, set the UPDATE_CONDITION variable to True in the config_run.py file. This will allow the model to adapt to changing market conditions by training on the most recent data.

Prediction

To make predictions, set the PREDICT_CONDITION variable to True in the config_run.py file. You can make predictions for a specific date and time by modifying the PREDICT_DATE and PREDICT_TIME variables.

## Note

This model is meant for educational and research purposes only. It is essential to exercise caution and not rely solely on machine learning models for financial decision-making.
